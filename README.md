# Calculator

I made this simple calculator with html, css, and js. I also used the math.js library, font awesome, and google fonts.

## Usage

This calculator can do basic calculations like additions, subtractions, divisions, and multiplications.

It also supports keyboard input for faster calculations.

## Design

The interface is user-friendly and visually appealing.

This calculator can be used on desktops, mobile, and tablets.

## Future improvements

When I have time:

- I will learn to change the appearance of the operators "/", "\*", and the dot "." in the results window, and apply the same appearance changes to the buttons.
- I will make main.js shorter and less repetitive.
- I will re-write main.js following javascript best practices.
