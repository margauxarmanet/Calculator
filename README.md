# Calculator
I made this simple calculator with html, css, and js. I also used the math.js library, font awesome, and google fonts.

## Usage
This calculator can do basic calculations like additions, subtractions, divisions, and multiplications. 

It also supports keyboard input for faster calculations.

## Design 
The interface is user-friendly and visually appealing.

This calculator can be used on desktops, mobile, and tablets.

### Improvements
When I have time, I will learn to change the appearance of the operators "*", "-", and the dot ".".
